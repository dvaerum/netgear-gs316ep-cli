# netgear-gs316ep-cli

I have a few Netgear GS316EP switches with I wanted an easy way to manage, so I built this CLI tool. It is in no way feature complete, but it as the option to update the switch and declare how the VLANs should be configured (tagged, untagged) on the different ports in one command.

The CLI can also trigger a power cycle of the ports PoE 😊

Pull request are welcome, but I am not planning to add feature if they get requested.

Enjoy your day and have fun 😁
